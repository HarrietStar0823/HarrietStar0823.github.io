            <p class="lead">Honoka Kousaka is the primary protagonist of Love Live!. She is a second year in Otonokizaka High School. 
                Her image color is orange, though she is often represented with pink. 
                She is also the leader of Printemps, a sub-unit under µ's and the leader of the group itself.
                Honoka's family owns a Japanese sweets shop named Homura. She lives at the back of the shop with her mother, father, 
                and her younger sister.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Since she was young, she has been friends with Kotori Minami, and she befriended Umi Sonoda after inviting her to 
                a game of hide-and-seek. She is also friends with Fumiko, Hideko and Mika at school. Her grandmother and her mother 
                are both graduates from Otonokizaka.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Honoka is an optimist who is never afraid to take risks. She is always in a good mood and likes to look at the bright side of things. 
                She is determined and once her mind is set on something, nothing can stop her. This is believed to be the driving force behind μ's 
                formation and success. But because of her persistent personality, she often overexerts herself.</p>

            <p class="lead">Eli Ayase is one of the nine main characters in Love Live!. She is a third year in Otonokizaka High School. 
                Her image color is ice-blue. She is the leader of BiBi, a sub-unit under μ's. Eli is partly Russian from her grandmother. 
                Because of this, she is known to say the Russian word "хорошо" (pronounced as "Harasho"), which means "Good" or "Okay." </p>
            <p class='lead'>She has a younger sister named Alisa Ayase. She told Umi that her family has been living abroad since they were little and haven't 
                really adapted to the lifestyle in Japan yet. Her grandmother is also an alumni of Otonokizaka High School, which furthered her urge 
                to defend her school from getting shut down.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Eli is shown to be a perfect role model to the students in Otonokizaka High School. As the former student council president, she is 
                often portrayed as a cold and strict character due to her responsibilities, and being against the idea of Honoka Kosaka and her friends 
                forming an idol group to get more attention from the public. However, ironically, Nozomi Tojo reveals that Eli was also trying to save the 
                school, but was denied permission to take action by the chairwoman.</p>

            <p class="lead">Umi Sonoda is one of the nine main characters in Love Live!. She is a second year in Otonokizaka High School. 
                Her image color is deep blue. She is the leader of lily white, a sub-unit under µ's.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Since she was young, Umi has been Honoka Kosaka and Kotori Minami's childhood friend, thanks to Honoka 
                inviting her to a game of hide-and-seek. She is also a member of the school's archery club, at which she is quite good. 
                She believes Honoka is bossy and pushy, but also realizes the perks of having an adventurous friend. Among the members 
                of μ's, Umi takes the role of being their physical trainer.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Umi has the qualities of a proper and traditional Japanese lady. As such, she is generally shy when having 
                to interact with unfamiliar people. Even with those she is comfortable with, she seems to act reserved by default unless provoked. 
                She is highly intelligent and a very logical solution-seeker. Above all, she is extremely disciplined -nearly to a fault- and as a result 
                can often be hard on others. However, this is never motivated by feelings of malice or dislike aimed at her friends.</p>

            <p class="lead">Kotori Minami is one of the nine main characters in Love Live!. She is a second year in Otonokizaka High School. She is also known as 
                "Legendary Maid Minalinsky" while working in Akihabara. Her image color is gray, though she is also represented with green or white. 
                She is a member of Printemps, a sub-unit under µ's. Since she was young, Kotori has been friends with Honoka Kosaka and Umi Sonoda. 
                Her mother is the chairwoman of the school board.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Kotori is known for having her head in the clouds. Despite this, she is μ's designer along with Nico Yazawa. Kotori has a very huge 
                aptitude for fashion and is very good at drawing costumes for the group. Kotori is shown to be very kind and supportive to her friends and 
                genuinely cares about them, especially their feelings. However, this can go too far as Kotori usually backs Honoka up when Honoka is scolded by Umi.
                Kotori is also shown as the most indecisive person among all nine members and tends to have Umi Sonoda and Honoka Kosaka, , her childhood friends, 
                make decisions for her. She also has a hard time expressing her feelings, since she always takes other people's feelings into consideration. </p>

            <p class="lead">Rin Hoshizora is one of the nine main characters in Love Live!. She is a first year in Otonokizaka High School. Her image color 
                is yellow, but is also represented with lime-green or teal. She is a member of lily white, a sub-unit under µ's.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Rin is a first year student who has been friends with Hanayo Koizumi since they were children. She is very well known for having
                a huge heart for cats and for acting like them; she tends to utter nya~! (meow), either as a way to end her sentences or to show her happiness. 
                In addition, she sometimes acts like a cat and does the signature curved-mouth look.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Rin appears to be a bit of a tomboy, though with a girly streak. She likes sports and is arguably the most athletic member of μ's.
                Like Honoka, Rin is very energetic, hard-working and active. One key difference between her and Honoka, however, is that Rin is known for being very mindful of other people's opinions, as she 
                puts their feelings first before taking action into something. This is shown multiple times throughout the anime.</p>

                of BiBi, a sub-unit under µ's. She is also the vice-president of the Idol Research Club.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Maki comes from a highly reputable and wealthy family marked by doctors and hospital ownership. She is an only child, and thus, the sole heiress to her family's 
                properties and legacy. Because of this, Maki is spoiled and doted on yet not given any long-term freedom to be anything other than a doctor. Maki respects her parents 
                and does not question their expectations despite the immense pressure to live up to their standards and make them proud.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Maki has the qualities of a tsundere, and she has a hard time admitting her true feelings to her peers. She also has somewhat childish beliefs which are 
                undoubtedly reflections on her somewhat sheltered upbringing. Her personality often clashes with Nico Yazawa, such as when she called Nico stubborn. Rin, however, 
                tells her "You're one to talk", implying that Maki is stubborn as well.</p>

                a sub-unit under μ's. Nozomi is a third year student and the former vice-president of the school's student council, being succeeded by Umi Sonoda. She is not originally 
                from the Kansai region, and it is shown in Season 2 Episode 8 that she and her family had moved around for most of her childhood. However, she speaks in a relaxed Kansai 
                dialect after having lived there for a few years during her childhood. She is fluent in a few other languages as well, including English. She is best friends with Eli.</p>
            <p class='lead'>As the former vice-president of the student council and the eldest member of μ's, Nozomi appears as a pretty wise, mysterious and mature girl with an almost all-knowing 
                vibe to her, due to her tarot reading and fortune-telling skills. She's gentle and kind, as well as rather conspirative, usually being the first person to advise μ's whenever they 
                run into an obstacle or trouble, and will usually remain calm and collected during most situations. This carries on even after joining μ's.</p>

            <p class='lead'>Normally, Nico has quite an abrasive personality, but when she takes on her alternate personality, she becomes a happy, upbeat character who is always smiling, often saying 
                her catchphrase, "Nico Nico Nii!" (にっこにっこにー), accompanied with a pose. She usually thinks a bit highly of herself but, despite that, she is also caring. her obsession with performative, 
                over-the-top happiness and cuteness is because of the difficulty of her home situation. Her family circumstances and the role she plays in it have led her to fixate on both making sure 
                as many people as possible are smiling and also seeking and receiving attention and praise. This manifests in her idol obsession and subsequent persona.A common joke in the series is that she's 
                often ignored by the other members of μ's when she claims that she is the better idol.Sometimes, her determination to become the best idol causes her to be a bit cold, calculating, and sometimes 
                even evil in her intentions</p>

            <p class='lead'>Hanayo is a very shy, quiet character who doesn't normally voice her opinions. She is very reserved and will often let other people make decisions for her because of this. Hanayo is also easily scared. 
                However, her personality changes when it comes to school idols, as she is very enthusiastic about them. Hanayo loves to eat anything, especially rice balls. For that reason, she usually gets upset with her weight.
                Hanayo is interested in drawing and origami and is obsessed with school idols. She is a caretaker for the school's alpacas.</p>
